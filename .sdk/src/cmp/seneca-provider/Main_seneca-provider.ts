// The `seneca-provider` target: a Seneca plugin exposing this API's entities
// as Seneca entities (`provider/<name>/<entity>`), layered on the sibling
// `ts` SDK.
//
// A consumer target in the go-cli / py-data mould — every standard phase is
// off in model/target/seneca-provider.aon and this component emits the
// whole package. It differs from those in one way that shapes everything
// here: it generates into ITS OWN REPO (`output: path`), depends on the SDK
// as a PUBLISHED npm package rather than by path, and therefore carries a
// repo's worth of furniture rather than a subfolder's.
//
// SHAPE OF THE MAPPING
//
// Seneca's store commands are list / load / save / remove. The SDK's are
// list / load / create / update / remove. `save` is the one that is not
// one-to-one: Seneca's convention is that an entity carrying an id is an
// update and one without is a create, so `save` dispatches on `data.id`.
//
// Everything else follows from the model:
//   - which cmds exist at all, from the entity's declared ops;
//   - the required path params of each op, which become argument guards (a
//     nested entity like `moon` under `/planet/{planet_id}/moon` cannot build
//     its URL without the parent id, and an opaque 404 from a half-built URL
//     is a bad error message);
//   - the SDK accessor and entity class names, from the same helpers the ts
//     target uses, so the two cannot drift.


// Seneca store cmd -> the SDK ops it needs. `save` needs BOTH create and
// update; it is emitted when either is present and dispatches on the id.
const CMD_OPS: Record<string, string[]> = {
  list: ['list'],
  load: ['load'],
  save: ['create', 'update'],
  remove: ['remove'],
}


// The required (non-optional) request keys of an op, id first. These are what
// the SDK needs to build the path, so they are what the provider must have
// before it calls.

}


// The key that addresses ONE record.
//
// `entityIdField` answers whenever the model declares one, which apidef does
// for any entity carrying a field literally named `id` — and it renames an
// `<entity>_id` path param to `id` besides, which is why most APIs never reach
// the fallback.
//
// When it does NOT answer, the record key is the LAST path param of the
// op's own point, in PATH order — a route addresses parents first and the
// record last, by construction. Without this the key was simply unknown,
// so a param named `code` failed the `!== idf` test in opParentKeys and
// was classified as a PARENT — `load$('SAVE20')` threw "coupon load: code
// is required" instead of loading anything, and the entity was treated as
// nested throughout.
//
// opParams(op) is NOT the source here: it alphabetizes params for output
// stability, which loses path order on a 3+-param route — Airtable's
// record (base_id, table_id, record_id) alphabetizes with table_id last,
// so the old `params[params.length - 1]` picked the wrong parent as the
// record's own key. The point's own `parts` still has the true order.
