// The `seneca-provider` target: a Seneca plugin exposing this API's entities
// as Seneca entities (`provider/<name>/<entity>`), layered on the sibling
// `ts` SDK.
//
// A consumer target in the go-cli / py-data mould — every standard phase is
// off in model/target/seneca-provider.aon and this component emits the
// whole package. It differs from those in one way that shapes everything
// here: it generates into ITS OWN REPO (`output: path`), depends on the SDK
// as a PUBLISHED npm package rather than by path, and therefore carries a
// repo's worth of furniture rather than a subfolder's.
//
// SHAPE OF THE MAPPING
//
// Seneca's store commands are list / load / save / remove. The SDK's are
// list / load / create / update / remove. `save` is the one that is not
// one-to-one: Seneca's convention is that an entity carrying an id is an
// update and one without is a create, so `save` dispatches on `data.id`.
//
// Everything else follows from the model:
//   - which cmds exist at all, from the entity's declared ops;
//   - the required path params of each op, which become argument guards (a
//     nested entity like `moon` under `/planet/{planet_id}/moon` cannot build
//     its URL without the parent id, and an opaque 404 from a half-built URL
//     is a bad error message);
//   - the SDK accessor and entity class names, from the same helpers the ts
//     target uses, so the two cannot drift.


// Seneca store cmd -> the SDK ops it needs. `save` needs BOTH create and
// update; it is emitted when either is present and dispatches on the id.
const CMD_OPS: Record<string, string[]> = {
  list: ['list'],
  load: ['load'],
  save: ['create', 'update'],
  remove: ['remove'],
}


// The custom ACTIONS one Seneca cmd can reach, as action name -> SDK op.
//
// apidef folds a non-CRUD verb into an ordinary op as an extra point marked
// `select.$action`: GitHub's `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/merge` is a
// second point of `pull.update`, beside the canonical `PATCH`. The SDK
// selects one with `$action` in the call's argument; without this map the
// provider has no way to name one at all, and `merge` is simply unreachable
// through a generated plugin.
//
// KEYED BY CMD, NOT BY OP, and that is the whole point of the function.
// `save` covers create AND update, so an action folded into `create` arrives
// through `save$` exactly as one folded into `update` does — assuming
// `update` would send `upload_image` (petstore's
// `POST /pet/{petId}/uploadImage`, a create point) to the wrong endpoint, and
// the SDK would then refuse it as an invalid action on an operation the
// caller never named.
//
// A name claimed by an earlier op WINS: `entityActions` walks the op map in
// sorted-key order, so for `save` that is create before update. Two ops of
// one entity sharing an action name is not something apidef produces from a
// spec — the name comes from the route — and if it ever does, a stable choice
// beats a last-writer-wins one.

// `<entity>_id` path param to `id` besides, which is why most APIs never reach
// the fallback.
//
// When it does NOT answer, the record key is the LAST path param of the
// op's own point, in PATH order — a route addresses parents first and the
// record last, by construction. Without this the key was simply unknown,
// so a param named `code` failed the `!== idf` test in opParentKeys and
// was classified as a PARENT — `load$('SAVE20')` threw "coupon load: code
// is required" instead of loading anything, and the entity was treated as
// nested throughout.
//
// opParams(op) is NOT the source here: it alphabetizes params for output
// stability, which loses path order on a 3+-param route — Airtable's
// record (base_id, table_id, record_id) alphabetizes with table_id last,
// so the old `params[params.length - 1]` picked the wrong parent as the
// record's own key. The point's own `parts` still has the true order.
// The path parameters that TOGETHER name one record, when no single one does.
//
// apidef sets `id.parts` for an API that addresses a record by several
// adjacent path parameters — github needs {owner} AND {repo} to name a

// HOW THE PROVIDER DEPENDS ON THE SDK IT WRAPS, as one dependency value.
//
// Default: the PUBLISHED package pinned to the version the `ts` target
// publishes, so the two can never disagree. Right whenever the SDK is on a
// registry — and wrong when it is not. An SDK for a private API, or one not
// published yet, leaves the provider unable to `npm install` at all: the
// dependency 404s, so the package cannot be built, tested or released. That
// is not hypothetical; it is why @seneca/github-provider could not be
// regenerated and released for weeks.
//
// `kind: 'git'` points at a GIT TAG instead, which needs no registry.
//
// NPM RESOLVES A GIT DEPENDENCY AGAINST THE REPOSITORY ROOT, and sdkgen
// generates the TypeScript SDK into `ts/`. So `kind: 'git'` suits an SDK
// whose package.json IS the repository root, and NOT the layout this
// toolchain produces.
//
// THE `::path:` SUBDIRECTORY SYNTAX DOES NOT WORK, and it looks like it
// does. npm-package-arg parses `#<ref>::path:ts` and reports
// `gitSubdir: /ts`, so a spec built that way reads as correct — but the
// INSTALLER ignores it: npm clones the repository and opens package.json at
// the clone root, failing with ENOENT on linux, macOS and Windows alike.
// That was measured, on all three, after the parser had said otherwise.
//
// `kind: 'release'` is the form that works for a package in a subdirectory:
// a GitHub release asset, which is `npm pack` output attached to the tag.
// npm installs an https tarball natively and never looks at the repository
// layout at all.
//
// `spec` still wins over all of it, for anything the shorthand cannot say.
