#
# THE SPLIT IS THE POINT. A compromised dependency lifecycle script can ask
# the runner for any OIDC token the JOB is permitted to mint, so a job that
# both installs dependencies and holds \`id-token: write\` can be made to
# publish as this package before its own gates finish. Keeping the install in

# is what makes the isolation real rather than nominal.
#
# The trusted publisher must be registered on npmjs.com for this package
# against THIS filename (publish.yml); renaming this file breaks publishing
# until the npm-side config is updated to match.
#
# npm cannot configure a trusted publisher for a package that does not exist
# yet — the settings page appears once a version is on the registry. So the
# FIRST version of a new package is published by hand, once, with an
# authenticated npm; every release after that is a tag push.

Provides access to the ${provider.api} API using the Seneca _provider_
convention. ${provider.api} entities are represented as Seneca entities so that
they can be accessed using the Seneca entity API and messages.

Requests are handled by the [${provider.api} SDK](${provider.sdkRepoUrl}),
which is generated from the API's OpenAPI specification. This plugin is
generated from the same specification by
[@voxgig/sdkgen](https://github.com/voxgig/sdkgen) — do not edit it by hand,
change the model and regenerate.

See [seneca-entity](https://github.com/senecajs/seneca-entity) and the [Seneca Data

## Documentation

Full documentation lives in [\`doc/\`](doc/README.md) and follows the
[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr) framework:

| Document | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| [Tutorial](doc/tutorial.md) | Start here. Build a working script from an empty folder. |
| [How-to guides](doc/how-to.md) | Recipes for specific tasks. |
| [Reference](doc/reference.md) | Every pattern, entity, option and export. |
| [Explanation](doc/explanation.md) | Why the plugin is designed this way. |


## Quick Example

\`\`\`js
const Seneca = require('seneca')

const seneca = Seneca()
  .use('promisify')
  .use('entity')
  .use('env', { var: { $${provider.ENV}_APIKEY: '' } })
  .use('provider', {
    provider: {
      ${provider.lower}: {
        keys: { apikey: { value: '$${provider.ENV}_APIKEY' } },
      },
    },
  })
  .use('${provider.pkgName}')

await seneca.ready()

      // bare id and nothing else, but the generated handler calls
      // `need_<entity>_<parent>()` on every parent key before it reaches the
      // SDK — so for any entity that has one, the README's opening example
      // threw `<entity> load: <parent> is required`. Show the object form
      // with the parent keys the handler actually enforces; the bare-string
      // form stays for a parentless entity, where it is correct and shorter.
      // A COMPOSITE KEY IS ONE STRING, not a bag of keys. Its parents travel
      // inside the id, so the object form with them alongside is the shape
      // its own handler rejects — the example has to show the joined id.

## Install

\`\`\`sh
npm install ${provider.pkgName}
\`\`\`

This plugin expects the Seneca host framework to be present:

\`\`\`sh
npm install seneca seneca-entity seneca-promisify @seneca/provider @seneca/env
\`\`\`


## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`sdk\` | object | Passed straight to the \`${provider.sdkClass}\` constructor. Most usefully \`base\`, to point at a server. |
| \`test\` | boolean | Run the SDK in offline test mode (in-memory mock transport). |
| \`testopts\` | object | Seed and options for the mock, used only when \`test\` is true. |


## Entities

Each API entity is exposed as a Seneca entity under
\`provider/${provider.lower}/<entity>\`.

| Seneca entity | Commands | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
`)
    // Fields as well as commands: a reader deciding whether this plugin
    // covers what they need has to know what a record CONTAINS, and the
    // table used to answer only half the question.
    each(provider.entities, (e: any) => {
      const fields = 0 === e.fields.length ? '—' :

### Nested entities

Some entities live under a parent in the API path, so every command needs the
parent's id in the query. Leaving it out throws with a message naming the
missing key, rather than failing as an opaque 404 from a half-built URL.

    // point, and the SDK reaches it with `$action` in the call's argument.

    // treatment belongs here, because the Seneca spelling is DIFFERENT
    // (`action$`, trailing dollar, Seneca's directive convention) and a
    // reader who has only ever seen the SDK's would guess wrong.
    //
    // Undocumented, this is the state the plugin was in before: a GitHub
    // provider with a `pull` entity and no way to merge a pull request at
    // all, because nothing anywhere said the endpoint existed.

### Actions

Some API endpoints are not one of the five CRUD operations — merging a pull
request, uploading an image. The API definition folds each one into an
ordinary operation as an alternative route, and this plugin selects one with
the \`action$\` directive, alongside Seneca's own \`sort$\`, \`limit$\` and
\`fields$\`.

| Entity | Action | Route | Command |

        })
      })

      Content(`
An action returns that action's OWN response, which is not necessarily a
record of the entity it hangs off — check the API definition for its shape.
Naming an action the entity does not have throws, and names the ones it
does have. It never falls back to the plain command.

## Action Patterns

Every message pattern this plugin registers. The entity actions are the ones
\`seneca-entity\` dispatches to when you call \`list$\` / \`load$\` / \`save$\` /
\`remove$\` on a canon below — you rarely post them by hand, but they are what
appears in a Seneca log, and a plugin that documents one of nine is a plugin
whose logs cannot be read.

| Pattern | Description |
| --- | --- |
| \`sys:provider,provider:${provider.lower},get:info\` | Plugin and SDK version information. |

    const CMD_DESC: Record<string, string> = {
      list: 'List records',
      load: 'Load one record',
      save: 'Create or update a record',
      remove: 'Remove a record',
    }

    each(provider.entities, (e: any) => {
      each(e.cmds, (cmd: any) => {

## More Examples

### Offline testing

The SDK ships an in-memory mock transport, so this plugin can be exercised
with no server:

\`\`\`js
.use('${provider.pkgName}', { test: true, testopts: { entity: { ... } } })
\`\`\`

\`testopts\` is passed straight to the SDK's test constructor; \`entity\`
seeds the mock store. See \`test/seed.js\` for the shape.

`)
    if ('' !== provider.liveBase) {
      Content(`### Running against a server

\`\`\`js
.use('${provider.pkgName}', { sdk: { base: '${provider.liveBase}' } })
\`\`\`

The companion test server is distributed in the SDK's source repository
only. From a checkout beside this one:

\`\`\`sh
cd ${provider.sdkrel}/app && npm start
\`\`\`

Then \`node test/live.js\` reads from it, and \`node test/quick.js\` runs a
full create/update/load/remove cycle.

`)
    }

    Content(`
## Motivation

Applications rarely talk to one external service, and each service usually
arrives with its own client library, authentication style and error
conventions. That variety leaks into application code and makes it harder to
test.

The Seneca provider convention removes the variety: every external service
becomes a Seneca entity reached with \`list$\`, \`load$\`, \`save$\` and
\`remove$\`, so application code has one shape regardless of what it talks to.

The SDK underneath arrives at a similar conclusion from the other side — it
deliberately exposes entities rather than HTTP routes. This plugin is the
short bridge between the two.

## API

### Plugin export: \`${provider.pluginName}/sdk\`

Returns the configured \`${provider.sdkClass}\` instance, for the operations
the entity API does not cover:

\`\`\`js
const sdk = seneca.export('${provider.pluginName}/sdk')()
\`\`\`

// --- doc/tutorial.md ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// The Diataxis TUTORIAL: an empty folder to a working script in about fifteen
// minutes. It teaches, so it is deliberately narrower than the other three
// documents — one path, no alternatives, and no decisions asked of the
// reader.
//
// Two decisions shape this component.
//
// FIRST, a tutorial must never ask the reader to invent a value. Every id in
// the script is therefore either seeded here (offline) or read back from a
// list call (live) — never a literal that only happens to exist on the
// author's machine. That is also why a declared server is not by itself
// enough to choose the live lesson: the primary entity must be listable, and
// a nested primary entity must have a listable parent, or there is no honest
// way to come by the first id. Failing that the offline lesson runs, which is
// a complete tutorial in its own right rather than an apology for a missing
// server.
//
// SECOND, the step numbers are computed rather than written, because which
// steps exist depends on which cmds the model declares. `step()` counts as it
// emits, and the prose refers to what a step did rather than to a number that
// may not be there.
//
// The offline seed reuses seedRecord() — the same function behind
// test/seed.js — so what the reader is told to paste has the shape the SDK
// really answers with.

API. If you need ordering or paging, ask the API for it using fields it

that is not there and its list comes back empty rather than failing —
which, in a test, reads as a pass that proves nothing.`}

This is how this plugin's own suite runs, and it is the recommended way
to test application code that uses the provider: no server, no network,
and the same code path as production. See \`test/seed.js\`, which seeds
every entity this way.`)

constructor, so \`base\` chooses the host:

  sdk: { base: 'https://${provider.lower}.example.com' },
})

relying on: set \`base\` explicitly, or run against the mock instead (see
[${OFFLINE_TITLE}](${anchor(OFFLINE_TITLE)})).` :
    `The SDK's own default is \`${liveBase}\`, which is where the
companion test server listens, so local development usually needs no
\`base\` at all.`}`)


  sec('Send an API key', `Credentials are not a plugin option: they come through the provider
convention, so that every provider in an application is configured the
same way. Declare the variable with \`env\` and set the key under this
provider's name:

\`\`\`js
  .use('env', {
    var: { $${provider.ENV}_APIKEY: String },
  })
  .use('provider', {
    provider: {
      ${provider.lower}: {

          apikey: { value: '$${provider.ENV}_APIKEY' },
        },
      },
    },
  })
\`\`\`

Every request then carries \`authorization: Bearer <apikey>\`. An absent
or empty key adds no header at all, so an API that needs no credentials
is configured in exactly the same shape with an empty value — which is
why it is worth writing even when there is nothing to send. An
application that later moves to an authenticated service then changes one
value rather than its structure.

For a different scheme, set the header yourself. Headers supplied through
\`sdk\` win over the one the key would have set:

\`\`\`js
.use('${provider.pkgName}', {
  sdk: { headers: { 'x-api-key': process.env.${provider.ENV}_APIKEY } },

\`version\` is this plugin's; \`sdk.version\` is the SDK it is running
against. That pair is what to quote in a bug report, because the two are
released separately and most surprises live in the gap between them.`)

      `${dpe.name}0` : `${k.replace(/_id$/, '')}0`

    sec('Reach the SDK directly', `The entity API covers the operations the API model declares. For
anything else — an endpoint with no entity behind it, a response header
you need to read — take the configured SDK client out of the plugin's
exports:

\`\`\`js
const sdk = seneca.export('${provider.pluginName}/sdk')()
\`\`\`

The export is a function, so call it, and it only answers after
\`seneca.ready()\` — that is when the plugin builds the client with the
resolved key.

SDK operations resolve to SDK ENTITY instances rather than plain data, so
read the record out with \`.data()\`. The provider does this for you; here
you do it yourself:

\`\`\`js${dpe.cmds.includes('list') ? `
const ${dpe.name}s = (await sdk.${dpe.acc}().list(${listArgs(dpe)}))
  .map((r) => r.data())
` : ''}${dpe.cmds.includes('load') ? `
const one = (await sdk.${dpe.acc}().load(${sdkLoadArgs(dpe)})).data()
` : ''}\`\`\`

For a route the entity model does not cover at all, \`direct\` sends a
request and hands back the raw response:

\`\`\`js
const res = await sdk.direct({
  path: '${dpath}',
  method: 'GET',${0 === dparams.length ? '' : `
  params: { ${dparams.map((k: string) => `${key(k)}: '${dval(k)}'`).join(', ')} },`}
})

if (res instanceof Error) throw res
if (!res.ok) throw (res.err || new Error('status ' + res.status))

console.log(res.data)
\`\`\`

\`prepare()\` builds the same request without sending it, which is the
quickest way to see what the SDK would actually do — url, method, headers
and body, before anything leaves the process.

Raw data becomes a Seneca entity again through \`data$\`:

\`\`\`js
const ent = seneca.entity('${canon(dpe)}').data$(res.data)
\`\`\``)
  }


  sec('Develop against a local SDK checkout', `The SDK is an ordinary published dependency, so normal use needs nothing
special:

\`\`\`sh
$ npm install
\`\`\`

If you are changing the SDK and this plugin together, point npm at a
local checkout instead. Clone the SDK beside this repository, at the path
this project expects, and build it — it does not commit its build output:

\`\`\`sh
$ git clone ${provider.sdkRepoUrl}.git \\
    ${provider.sdkrel}
$ cd ${provider.sdkrel}/ts
$ npm install && npm run build
\`\`\`

Then link it in, without committing the change to \`package.json\`:

\`\`\`sh
$ npm install --no-save ${provider.sdkrel}/ts
\`\`\`

npm creates a symlink, so a rebuild of the SDK is picked up here with no
reinstall:

\`\`\`sh
$ ls -l node_modules/${provider.sdkPkg}
\`\`\`

To go back to the published SDK:

\`\`\`sh
$ rm -rf node_modules/${provider.sdkPkg} package-lock.json && npm install
\`\`\`

Removing the lockfile matters. npm will happily keep resolving to the
link if the lockfile still records it and the local version satisfies the
range.`)

it found it.${subject.cmds.includes('save') && subject.cmds.includes('remove') ? `

Two manual scripts are there for poking at a running server by hand:

$ npm run watch      # the same, in watch mode
$ npm run reset      # clean, install, build, test

Releasing follows the Seneca convention, in one command — clean, install,
build, test, tag from \`package.json\`, publish:

\`\`\`sh
$ npm run repo-publish
\`\`\`

Only \`dist\`, the TypeScript sources and the licence file are published;
the test suite and its build output stay in the repository.

Before publishing, check that \`package.json\` still depends on the
published SDK by version range and not on a local path: a \`file:\`
dependency left behind from local development installs perfectly on your
own machine and cannot be resolved by anybody else.

One last thing: this repository is GENERATED from the ${provider.api} API
model by [@voxgig/sdkgen](https://github.com/voxgig/sdkgen). An edit made
here survives exactly as long as the next generation run. Change the
model, or the components that build this target, and regenerate.`)

The plugin name is \`${provider.pluginName}\`. It must be registered after
\`entity\`, \`promisify\` and \`provider\`:

\`\`\`js
Seneca({ legacy: false })
  .use('promisify')
  .use('entity')
  .use('provider', { ... })
`)

    if (live) {
      Content(`  .use('${provider.pkgName}', { sdk: { base: '${provider.liveBase}' } })
\`\`\`
`)
    }
    else {
      Content(`  .use('${provider.pkgName}', { sdk: { base: BASE } })
\`\`\`

The ${provider.api} definition declares no server, so there is no default
base URL: \`BASE\` is the URL of the API you are talking to, and it must be
supplied through the \`sdk\` option.
`)
    }

    Content(`
The SDK client is constructed during plugin startup and is not available
until \`seneca.ready()\` resolves.

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Effect |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ------ |
| \`sdk\` | object | \`{}\` | Passed straight to the \`${provider.sdkClass}\` constructor. Most usefully \`base\`. |
| \`test\` | boolean | \`false\` | Run the SDK against its in-memory mock transport instead of HTTP. |
| \`testopts\` | object | \`{}\` | Test-feature options, used only when \`test\` is true. \`{entity: {...}}\` seeds the mock. |

### \`sdk\`

Any option the \`${provider.sdkClass}\` constructor accepts:

| Key | Effect |
| --- | ------ |
| \`base\` | Base URL for API requests. ${live ?
      `The SDK's own default is \`${provider.liveBase}\`.` :
      'There is no default: this API declares no server, so it must be set.'} |
| \`prefix\` / \`suffix\` | URL fragments placed around the path. |
| \`headers\` | Headers sent on every request. These win over the \`authorization\` header the provider adds from a configured key. |
| \`system\` | System overrides, e.g. a custom \`fetch\`. |

### \`test\` and \`testopts\`

\`\`\`js
.use('${provider.pkgName}', {
  test: true,
  testopts: {
    entity: {
`)
    each(provider.entities, (e: any) => {
      Content(`      ${e.name}: { ${e.name}0: ${JSON.stringify(seedRecord(e, 0))} },
`)
    })
    Content(`    },
  },
})
\`\`\`

Mock records are keyed by id under their entity name. In this mode no
network calls are made, and an unseeded id produces the same not-found
behaviour as a live server. This package's own \`test/seed.js\` is generated
in exactly this shape.
`)

    if (0 < nested.length) {
      Content(`
A nested record's parent key must name a record the parent entity also
seeds: the mock resolves the path literally, so an unmatched parent id
yields nothing rather than an error.

    Content(`
## Entities

The plugin registers ${1 === provider.entities.length ?
      'one entity canon' : `${provider.entities.length} entity canons`}.
A canon carries only the commands its API operations support — an entity the
API offers no delete for has no \`remove$\` — so the tables below are the
whole of what each one answers.

### Create versus update

\`save$\` follows the Seneca convention: an entity **without** an id is
created, an entity **with** one is updated. The provider dispatches on the
id field, so the same call does both.

const ${s.name} = await seneca

${0 < writable.length ? `${s.name}.${writable[0].name} = ${value(writable[0], true)}
` : ''}await ${s.name}.save$()
\`\`\`

Whether a client-supplied id survives a create is a property of the API, not
of this plugin: many assign the id themselves and ignore the one sent. Read
the id back off the returned entity rather than assuming the one you set.

`)
    }

    Content(`
Every SDK operation resolves to an SDK entity instance, or a list of them,
rather than raw data. The provider calls \`.data()\` on each and hands the
plain record to \`entize\`, so what comes back is an ordinary Seneca entity
under this plugin's canon, carrying none of the SDK's own markers.

### Query fields

Seneca query directives — any key ending in \`$\`, such as \`sort$\` or
\`limit$\` — are stripped before the query reaches the SDK. They are
instructions to a store, not match fields for the API, and are not
otherwise supported.

\`action$\` is the one this plugin reads. It is stripped from the match
fields like the rest, but it is read FIRST, and it selects a custom API
action instead of the plain command. See
[Actions](#actions) below.

### Actions
${0 === acting.length ? `
This API declares no custom actions: every route is one of the five CRUD
operations, so \`action$\` has nothing to select and naming one throws.
` : `
An action is an API route folded into an ordinary operation as an
alternative point — a verb that is not create, read, update or delete.
Select one with the \`action$\` directive; the rest of the call is that
action's own payload.

| Entity | Action | Route | Operation | Command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
${acting.map((e: any) => e.actionList.map((a: any) =>
  `| \`${e.name}\` | \`${a.action}\` | \`${a.path}\` | \`${a.op}\` | \`${a.cmd}$\` |`)
  .join('\n')).join('\n')}

On a read command (\`list$\`, \`load$\`, \`remove$\`) \`action$\` is a key of
the query. On \`save$\` it is a directive on the entity, set with
\`directive$({ action$: '...' })\` or assigned as a property —
\`make$({ action$ })\` does NOT work, because \`seneca-entity\`'s \`make$\`
drops any trailing-\`$\` key it does not know by name.

Routing is by the operation the action belongs to, not by the command:
\`save$\` covers both create and update, so an action folded into \`create\`
is called as a create even when the entity carries an id.

An action name the entity does not have throws, naming the entity, the
command and the valid actions. It never falls back to the plain command.
`}

## Action patterns

### \`sys:provider,provider:${provider.lower},get:info\`

Returns metadata about the plugin and SDK. Answered locally; makes no API
call.

\`\`\`js
await seneca.post('sys:provider,provider:${provider.lower},get:info')
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
{
  ok: true,
  name: '${provider.lower}',
  version: '${provider.version}',
  sdk: {
    name: '${provider.sdkPkg}',
    version: '${provider.sdkVersion}',
  },
}
\`\`\`

Both versions are read at runtime from the respective \`package.json\`, so
they describe what is installed rather than what was generated.

### Entity patterns

Registered by \`@seneca/provider\`. Normally reached through the entity API
rather than posted directly.

| Pattern |
| ------- |
`)
    each(provider.entities, (e: any) => {
      Content(e.cmds
        .map((c: string) =>
          `| \`sys:entity,zone:provider,base:${provider.lower},name:${e.name},cmd:${c}\` |\n`)
        .join(''))
    })

    Content(`
### Inherited from \`@seneca/provider\`

| Pattern | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| \`sys:provider,get:key\` | Fetch one named key for a provider. |
| \`sys:provider,get:keymap\` | Fetch all keys for a provider. |
| \`sys:provider,list:provider\` | List registered providers and their key names. |

## Plugin exports

### \`${provider.pluginName}/sdk\`

A function returning the configured \`${provider.sdkClass}\` instance.

\`\`\`js
const sdk = seneca.export('${provider.pluginName}/sdk')()
`)
    if (subject.ops.includes('list')) {
      Content(`
// Every SDK operation resolves to an SDK entity (or a list of them),
// not raw data; \`.data()\` gives the plain record.
const ${subject.name}s = (await sdk.${subject.acc}().list()).map((e) => e.data())
`)
    }
    if ('' !== provider.probePath) {
      Content(`
// \`direct\` reaches endpoints outside the entity model.
const res = await sdk.direct({ path: '${provider.probePath}', method: 'GET' })

    if (anyCmd('load')) {
      Content(`| \`load$\` for a non-existent id | Resolves to \`null\`. |

`)
    }
    Content(`| Any other non-2xx response | Thrown as raised by the SDK. |
| A request that never got a response | Thrown, with \`status\` \`-1\`. |

SDK errors are \`${provider.Name}Error\` instances carrying
\`is${provider.Name}Error: true\`, a \`code\` (e.g. \`request_status\`), the
HTTP \`status\` at the top level (\`-1\` when the request never got a
response), a \`notFound\` flag, and a \`ctx\` holding the request context and
its \`result\` — \`status\`, \`statusText\`, \`headers\` and \`body\`. The
\`null\`-on-missing behaviour is triggered by \`err.notFound\`, not by
inspecting the status at the call site.

\`\`\`js
try {
  await seneca.entity('${canon(subject)}').${errCall}

  console.error(err.code, err.status, err.notFound)

## Authentication keys

The plugin follows the provider convention: if an \`apikey\` key is
configured and non-empty, it is sent as \`authorization: Bearer <apikey>\`
on every request. If the provider is not registered, or the key is absent or
empty, no header is added and startup proceeds normally — an API that needs
no credential exercises the same path.

\`\`\`js
  .use('provider', {
    provider: {
      ${provider.lower}: {
        keys: {
          apikey: { value: '$${provider.ENV}_APIKEY' },
        },
      },
    },
  })
\`\`\`

The key is read once, during \`seneca.prepare()\`, by posting
\`sys:provider,get:keymap,provider:${provider.lower}\`. An \`authorization\`
header supplied through the \`sdk.headers\` option takes precedence over it.

## Environment variables

The plugin never reads the environment itself. These are the variables the
surrounding convention and tooling resolve:

| Variable | Read by | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| \`$${provider.ENV}_APIKEY\` | \`@seneca/env\` | Supplies the \`apikey\` value when the key is declared as \`'$${provider.ENV}_APIKEY'\`, as above. |

## Package scripts

| Script | Action |
| ------ | ------ |

// most of which is true of EVERY provider this target emits (the entityBuilder
// convention, the four-cmds-to-five-ops join, the .data() hop, the 404

    Content(`# Explanation

This document discusses why \`${provider.pkgName}\` is built the way it is.
It does not tell you how to do anything — for that see the
[tutorial](tutorial.md) and the [how-to guides](how-to.md), and for the exact
patterns, entities and options, the [reference](reference.md). The whole set is
indexed in [doc/README.md](README.md).


## The provider convention

Seneca applications talk to the outside world through *providers*. A provider
is a plugin that makes a third-party API look like a Seneca data source, so
application code uses the entity API it already knows instead of learning a
client library per service.

The payoff is uniformity. An application reading from ${provider.api}, a
payment processor and a CRM uses one access pattern for all three:

\`\`\`js
await seneca.entity('provider/${provider.lower}/${subject.name}').list$()
await seneca.entity('provider/stripe/charge').list$()
\`\`\`

Because these are ordinary Seneca entities, everything built on the entity API
— logging, tracing, message interception, test doubles — applies to remote
calls without any special support for HTTP.


## What entityBuilder buys

The convention is more than a naming scheme. \`@seneca/provider\` exports
\`provider/entityBuilder\`, and this plugin hands it exactly one thing: a map
from entity name to a small set of cmd actions. Recognising the
\`provider/${provider.lower}/\` canon, registering the \`role:entity\` messages
that sit behind \`list$\`, \`load$\`, \`save$\` and \`remove$\`, and turning
whatever an action returns into an entity of the right canon — none of that is
written here. It arrives with the convention.

What remains is a handful of async functions, each a few lines long, whose
whole job is to call the SDK and hand the result back through the \`entize\`
function entityBuilder supplies. That thinness is the point rather than an
accident of effort: a provider that is nearly all glue can be read at a glance,
generated in full, and regenerated when the API moves. Cleverness added here is
cleverness that has to be maintained against a moving target.


## Two layers of the same idea

This provider is unusual among Seneca providers in that the thing it wraps is
*already* entity-shaped. The ${provider.api} SDK exposes accessors like
\`client.${subject.acc}()\` — carrying
${list(subject.ops)} —
rather than raw HTTP routes, for much the same reason Seneca does. A small,
uniform surface is easier for people and for agents to reason about than a set
of URL templates.

So the provider is mostly a translation between two entity models that already
agree on the important things. Where they *disagree* is where this plugin has
to do real work, and each disagreement is discussed below.


## Where the SDK and Seneca disagree

### Four commands, five operations

Seneca's store commands are \`list\`, \`load\`, \`save\` and \`remove\`. The
SDK's operations are \`list\`, \`load\`, \`create\`, \`update\` and \`remove\`.
Four of the five line up. \`save\` is the join, and it dispatches on the id: an
entity carrying one is an update, an entity without one is a create.

`)

    if (0 < writable.length) {
      Content(`That is Seneca's convention rather than this plugin's invention, and it is a
good one. Exposing create and update separately would push the HTTP verb back
into application code — the caller who loaded a record, changed a field and
called \`save$\` would have to know whether that becomes a POST or a PUT. The
presence of the id already answers the question. Asking the caller to answer it
again only adds a way to be wrong.

`)
    }

    Content(`Which commands exist at all is decided per entity, from the operations the API
declares, rather than from an assumption that everything is CRUD.
\`${subject.name}\` carries
${list(subject.cmds.map((c: string) => c + '$'))}.
${othersSentence}
An entity whose API has no create and no update simply has no \`save$\`, which
is a better answer than a \`save$\` that exists and then fails at the HTTP
layer.

`)

    if (0 < onesided.length) {
      Content(`Where an entity declares only one of create and update there is nothing to

`)
      })
      Content(`
`)
    }

    Content(`### Entity instances versus plain data

Every SDK operation resolves to an SDK entity instance, never to raw data:
\`list\` to a list of them, and each single-record operation to one. The record
is absorbed into the instance and read back through \`.data()\`.${0 < removable.length ?
      ` A removed\nentity is the same instance, marked deleted, still holding what it held.` : ''}

Seneca's \`entize\` wants plain data, so the provider takes the \`.data()\` hop
on everything the SDK hands back, before it goes anywhere near an entity. That
is the whole of the \`plain\` helper in the source, and it is the only place in
the plugin that knows the SDK deals in instances at all.

The hop earns its keep for a second reason. An SDK instance carries its own
serialisation marker, and that marker must not survive into a Seneca entity:
Seneca reads \`entity$\` on a data object as the *canon*. A marker landing on
that key would be taken as a canon, and the record would come back under the
wrong one — or under none. The SDK namespaces its marker so the collision
cannot happen by accident, but normalising at this boundary is still the right
call. It is what makes the data plain, and it keeps the provider independent of
whatever the SDK decides to carry alongside a record.

`)

    if (0 < loadable.length) {
      Content(`### Missing things

\`load$\` for an id that does not exist resolves to \`null\`. Only a 404 is
translated this way; every other failure propagates.

"This thing does not exist" is an ordinary answer to a lookup, not a failure of
the lookup. It is usually a branch in the caller's logic, and forcing every call
site into a \`try\`/\`catch\` to express that branch makes the common path noisy.
A malformed request, a rejected credential or an unreachable server means
something else entirely: the question could not be asked, and that should
interrupt rather than quietly look like an empty result.

The SDK does not draw this line — it throws for any non-2xx — so the provider
asks the thrown error, which reports \`notFound\` and the HTTP \`status\` at the
top level. That coupling to the SDK's error shape is a deliberate and narrow
one, and it is why the shape is written down in the
[reference](reference.md).

      Content(`### Missing things

Nothing here reads a single record by id, but \`remove$\` still has to decide
what "it was not there" means, and it treats a 404 as an ordinary outcome rather
than a failure: the record is gone, which is what the caller asked for. Every
other failure — a malformed request, a rejected credential, an unreachable
server — means the question could not be asked at all, and propagates.

The SDK does not draw that line; it throws for any non-2xx. So the provider asks

${nestLead}
Seneca's entity model is flat — a canon has no notion of a parent.

The gap is bridged by putting the parent id in the query, which is why
\`${n.parents[0]}\` is required on every \`${n.name}\` command${n.cmds.includes('load') ?
        `, and why\n\`${n.name}\` \`load$\` takes an object rather than a bare id string` : ''}.
This is inherited from the API's URL structure — \`${n.path}\` — rather than
chosen here.

The provider checks for \`${n.parents[0]}\` itself and throws a named error
rather than letting the request go out. Without the check, the SDK builds a URL
with a missing segment and the server answers 404${n.cmds.includes('load') ?
        `, and that 404 is\nindistinguishable from "that ${n.name} does not exist" — which the provider\nwould then dutifully translate to \`null\`. A forgotten argument would look\nexactly like an empty result` :

wrong answer into an obvious mistake.

    Content(`### Query directives

Seneca store queries can carry directives such as \`sort$\` and \`limit$\`.
These are instructions to a *store*, and the API has no equivalent, so the
provider strips any key ending in \`$\` before the query becomes an API match.

Passing them through would be worse than dropping them: the SDK would forward
them as ordinary match fields, and the API would either ignore them or reject
the request outright. Dropping them is imperfect too — a caller who writes
\`list$({ sort$: 'name' })\` gets unsorted results and no complaint — but it is
the behaviour least likely to produce a wrong answer, and the limitation is
documented rather than hidden. Sorting and limiting belong on the caller's
side, or in the API's own query fields where it has them.


`)

    if (0 < writable.length) {
      Content(`## Why writes are supported here

The read-only question is worth asking of every provider, and the answer here
follows from the API rather than from taste.

Writes map cleanly onto entities only when the API's notion of "save" is
unambiguous. For a CMS with draft states, localised fields and a separate
publish step, \`save$\` would have to pick one interpretation and would mislead
whoever guessed differently. Here the write operations are plain whole-record
ones, so \`save$\` can mean exactly one thing for each of
${list(writable.map((e: any) => e.name))}, and the store surface those
operations support is implemented in full.

One wrinkle does not map cleanly. Seneca's model lets a caller choose an id;
many APIs assign ids themselves and ignore any id sent on create. The provider
does not try to paper over that, because it cannot make a server honour an id
it did not issue. Code that predicts the id of a record it is about to create
will be wrong on such an API, and the remedy is to read the id back from what
\`save$\` returns rather than to guess it beforehand.


`)
    }
    else {
      Content(`## Why this provider only reads

Every entity here exposes reads alone. That is not a policy decision taken in
the plugin: the cmd map is built from the operations the API declares, and none
of these entities declares a create or an update. A \`save$\` that existed only
to fail at the HTTP layer would be worse than no \`save$\` at all — the absence
is the honest signal, and it appears in the entity table in the
[reference](reference.md).

If the API grows write operations, they arrive here by regeneration rather than
by hand. Nothing about the mapping is waiting to be written.


`)
    }

    Content(`## Credentials, whether or not the API needs them

At startup the plugin asks \`@seneca/provider\` for the keymap of
\`${provider.lower}\` and sends the \`apikey\` as a bearer token when one is
configured.

The key is *optional*. Absent, unconfigured and empty all mean "send no
header", and none of them is an error. For an API that needs no credential this
looks like ceremony, and it is worth keeping anyway: the shape of a Seneca
application should not depend on whether a particular service happens to need a
key. An application that moves from an open endpoint to an authenticated
deployment then changes one configuration value rather than restructuring how
the plugin loads — and a provider that demanded a key from an API that has none
would force every user to invent a fake one.


## Depending on a published SDK

The SDK is an ordinary published dependency: \`${provider.sdkPkg}\` at
\`^${provider.sdkVersion}\`, resolved by npm like anything else.

The alternative is vendoring — copying the generated client into this
repository. That is tempting, since both artefacts come from the same model and
change together. It is also wrong. It makes a second copy of something that is
regenerated whenever the API moves, and it puts this plugin's release cycle in
charge of the API's. As a dependency, the SDK carries its own semantic version:
when the API changes, the SDK is versioned, and this plugin either follows the
range or pins until it is ready. Keeping them separable also matters to the
people who use the SDK with no Seneca anywhere in sight.

One consequence of depending on generated code is worth stating plainly. The
SDK is regenerated as the API model changes, so its surface can shift in ways a
hand-written library's would not. That argues for keeping this plugin thin, and
for pinning behaviour in tests. Everything this plugin knows about the SDK's
shapes is concentrated in three small functions — the \`.data()\` hop, the query
cleaner and the not-found translation — plus the construction of the client, so
an SDK change is absorbed in one place and surfaces as a failing offline test
rather than as a surprise in production.

`)

    if ('' === provider.liveBase) {
      Content(`The API definition declares no server, so this plugin has no default host: the
base URL arrives through the \`sdk.base\` option, supplied by whoever configures
the plugin for a particular deployment. The tests therefore run entirely
against the SDK's mock transport, which is the one host that is always
available.


`)
    }
    else {
      Content(`The distinction that does survive is between the SDK and its **test server**.
The SDK is published; the server is not, and ships only in

is why the live tests probe for the server and skip rather than fail: the common
case is a contributor who has the dependency but not the repository.


`)
    }

    Content(`## A generated plugin

Nothing in this repository is hand-written. The plugin source, its tests, its CI
workflow, its manifest and these documents are all emitted by
[@voxgig/sdkgen](https://github.com/voxgig/sdkgen) from the ${provider.api} API
model — the same model the SDK is generated from, which is why the two cannot
disagree about entity names, id fields, or which operations exist.

There is one blunt consequence for anyone reading the code and reaching for an
edit: the edit will not survive. The next generation run overwrites this
repository, without a merge and without a warning. A fix applied here is a fix
that has to be applied again, silently, forever.

The source of truth is the SDK project's model — \`${provider.sdkrel}\` from
here, if both are checked out — together with the sdkgen component that emits
this target. A change to *what* the API offers belongs in the model; a change to
*how* the provider expresses it belongs in the component. Both are versioned,
both regenerate every provider built this way rather than just this one, and
both are where a fix is worth making. See
[Contributing](../README.md#contributing).


## How the tests are arranged

The suite runs offline by default. It needs no credentials and no network.

The **offline** tests use the SDK's own mock transport, reached through this
plugin's own options:

\`\`\`js
.use('${provider.pkgName}', {
  test: true,
  testopts: { entity: { ${subject.name}: { '${subject.name}0': { ... } } } },
})
\`\`\`

This is better than the usual provider-testing compromise. Rather than checking
only that the plugin loads and answers
\`sys:provider,provider:${provider.lower},get:info\`, the tests exercise the
entity commands themselves${coveredPhrase}
through the real code path, from a Seneca entity call down to the transport and
back. The only thing replaced is the socket. And because the mock belongs to the
SDK, it stays honest as the SDK changes: a regeneration that alters a return
shape breaks a test here rather than someone's production run.

Seeding the mock is not decoration either. The seed is generated from the same
model as the entities, so the records the tests read carry the fields the API
would really return${0 < nested.length ? `, and a nested record's parent id
names a parent record that exists — otherwise the nested tests would read an
empty store and pass without proving anything` : ''}.

    Content(`# Documentation

The documentation for \`${provider.pkgName}\` follows the
[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr) framework. Each document serves one purpose,
and that purpose decides what belongs in it. If you are unsure where to look,
use the table below.

| Document | Purpose | Read it when |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| [Tutorial](tutorial.md) | Learning-oriented. A lesson that takes you from nothing to a working script. | You have never used this plugin and want to see it work. |
| [How-to guides](how-to.md) | Task-oriented. Recipes that solve one problem each. | You know what you want to do and need the steps. |
| [Reference](reference.md) | Information-oriented. A complete, factual description of the interface. | You need to look up a message pattern, entity field, or option. |
| [Explanation](explanation.md) | Understanding-oriented. The reasoning behind the design. | You want to know *why* it works this way, or you are debugging something surprising. |

## The distinction that matters most

The tutorial and the how-to guides look alike — both are sequences of steps —
but they are not interchangeable.

The **tutorial** is a lesson. It is safe to follow, it produces a result you
can see, and it asks you to make no decisions. Its job is to build confidence,
so it deliberately avoids alternatives and edge cases.

A **how-to guide** assumes competence. It answers "how do I list every record
of a collection?", and it assumes you already have a working Seneca instance.
Its job is to get a task done, so it omits the explanation.

Likewise **reference** describes the machinery and nothing else — it never
teaches. **Explanation** discusses and gives context — it never instructs.

## These documents are generated

This plugin, and this documentation with it, is generated by
[@voxgig/sdkgen](https://github.com/voxgig/sdkgen) from the ${provider.api} API
definition held in the [SDK project](${provider.sdkRepoUrl}). An edit made here
is lost on the next regeneration.

Something genuinely specific to this API — a quirk of its authentication, a
rate limit worth warning about — belongs in the model the generator reads, not
in the output it writes. Everything else belongs in the generator's own
components, where fixing it once fixes every provider.
